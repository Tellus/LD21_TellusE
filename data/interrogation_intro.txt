I ran as well as I could, but eventually they caught
up to me. As they piled mercilessly onto my aching
body, my ribs creaked under the pressure. My breath
left me as I now realised my future was no more.

They brought me to the precinct, let me stew in
one of their interrogation rooms for what seemed like
hours. Didn't offer me a bath, water or even someone
to look at the scrapes the cops had given me.

Finally they brought in two investigators. If I didn't
know any better, I could've sworn they were running the
good cop, bad cop routine. One was an ill-mannered
cretin who was referenced as Sozowski. The other, less
mean, but also apparent simply introduced himself as
Dalum.

Then the real interrogation started. Sozowski was
ramming his fist into the table all the while demanding
that I admit my guilt and tell them what they needed
to know to put this "right". Dalum was backing him up,
telling me how easy it would be if I just gave it up
and came out clean - how little trouble I'd get in.

Obviously, they were both out after the same thing.
Nailing me. And I wasn't going down easy.
