After grilling me throughout the night I was tossed
into a dark and dank cell with the usual rabble.
Drunks, drug addicts, a hooker. Obviously, the police
cared little for their citizens' well-being. Most of
these people were victims to society, meaning no ill
will on anyone but themselves. Yet we deem it fit to
place those in the direst need of help in the
custody of the people who should simply protect our
basic human rights.

I felt like one of them.

The only reason I had been
doing this was to keep mother out of debt and for
Nyaa's treatment. We were poor, weak, we needed help.
And when I tried to get help in a way that would
hurt no one, I was placed in quarantine as if I was
infected.

I hardly slept. Seven people and three cots didn't
go well together, and as the addicts started to go
cold turkey the floor was no more inviting. The guards
came early, though, and hauled me to the courthouse.
Swift execution of justice, indeed.

The judge looked sternly at me as the jury sat down.
They had appointed me a dime-a-dozen defence lawyer.
Much good that would do me. I would have to rely on
my own cool to persuade the jury to my innocence.

I started to sweat. My tongue welled up in my mouth
as I clenched my fists together and started to answer
questions.
