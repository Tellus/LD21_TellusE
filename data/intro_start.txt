I want to tell you a story. A story about myself, and
what I was willing to do for love and for justice.
Then I'll tell you how these adventures end for people
like you and me, those of us just barely getting by
in life.

I was poor. Very poor. Lived with my mother and Nyaa
in a small apartment in the slums. Mother was neck-deep
in debt and Nyaa suffered from severe diabetes. We
didn't have money for her treatments, and she was
getting worse by the week. Without insulin she couldn't
live a balanced life, and with the money we had we
could only eat food that made her even worse.

A solution presented itself in an unlikely place. His
name was Phil, and that was all he told me. He talked
me up at a bar where I was trying to forget the hell
of life, instantly spotting the trouble I was in.

He suggested a simple way of giving me a better life.
A jewelry heist. A local shop owner, Mike Zackton, had
a jewelry store in town. If we were fast, we could get
in and grab a sackful each before the cops got there.

I accepted. At this point, I didn't care for the laws
of society any more. Capitalism would ensure that
Zackton had insurance, so he would be reimbursed for
any losses.

We went that same night. As expected, the alarm went off
the moment we smashed the window. My heart thumped and
sweat drenched off my brow as I scrambled to the nearest
pieces and raked them into the plastic bag I brought
along.

It only seemed like seconds before the first officer
yelled at us from the corner. Frantic, Phil and I sprang
out of the window and in either direction. We would
never see each other again.

I sprinted towards the nearest alley. The best way to 
handle this would be to dump the goods around the
dumpsters and come back when the road was clear.
I set to my task.
