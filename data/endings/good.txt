I gave a sigh of relief as the jury came out and
announced their verdict. There was insufficient
evidence to convict me. They could place me at the scene,
people had seen me and Phil driving together, but
all the loot had been recovered - untraceable back
to the two of us. And our alibis matched up.

My mother and Nyaa were none the wiser. They believed me
when I told them that I had nothing to do with the heist.
We went home as I pondered over a lesson well learned.

Crime isn't the answer. If you disagree with the law you
become a politician and either change it or dodge it. But
me, mother and Nyaa - we're better than that.

We may be poor, we may have it tough, but we're alive,
and we have each other.

Kissing them both passionately, I promised them that
everything would be better from now on.

I promise.
