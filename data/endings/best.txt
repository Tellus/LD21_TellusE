My heart was beating viciously as I stepped out of the
courthouse and onto the warm pavement outside. Drawing
the fresh air into my lungs, the world seemed to have
taken on a new beauty of its own. The jury had almost
scolded the prosecuting lawyer for dragging me into this.
"Clearly" I was innocent.

Colours were brighter, the sun was warmer, even Nyaa's
situation seemed like nothing at all. I had the means
to help her and my mother to a wonderful future.

Last I heard, Phil had been apprehended trying to
recover the loot downtown. Mike's security cameras had
picked him up while he was scouring the area. Ironic,
since the dolt was so intent on telling me never to
go back to the scene of a crime. He'll go in, for sure.
Maybe not a full sentence, but he was recorded during
the heist and I dropped enough information about him
to put him away long enough for me to move on.

Naturally, Mike's insurance paid for all his losses.
He's not worse off, not the least. The media exposure
and mention of extravagant jewelry has boosted his
business. There's no way he'd be unsatisfied. He's
just playing his part, with the weeping game.

Walking down the dirt path behind the courthouse, I
looked to the horison, and the sun, high in the sky.
Birds were singing, and the weight had been lifte off
my shoulders. Do I regret it? Not one bit.

And I never will.
