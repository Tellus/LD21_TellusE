My heart sank as the judge called out the verdict.

Guilty.

This had been a foolish venture from the beginning. If
only I'd had the good senses to see reason before it had
gotten this far, Nyaa and my mother would still have a
chance. Now they're on their own. I don't know how well
they'll handle themselves.

... mother cried when she heard the verdict. Nyaa
wouldn't even look at me. I ruined this. I'm to blame.

At least Phil took the fall with me. He hadn't budged
during Dalum's interrogation. But I did. Caved in harder
than the straw house. Didn't matter to me anymore. I'd
rather get off light than sit off a sentence and never
see a reward for it.

Sitting in here, on my hard, smelly cot, it's hard to
consider honessty a virtue. But I'd rather retain the
last vestiges of my decency and hold out for a life
after prison.

And so I wait for another chance. And this time, I won't
screw it up.
