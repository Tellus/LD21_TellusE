And that was it. All I had tried to do to better my life
had resulted in my damnation.

I started to think back on my mother, on Nyaa and how
I failed to help them. Within the month they would be
out on the streets, and she... she wouldn't get the help
she needed.

I had been found guilty, my peers had passed judgement
and I am to pass so much of my life behind the metal
grates of my cell, rotting away while those I loved and
only wanted to help will be treated even worse.

Phil can rot for all I care. He's probably out there,
recovering all the loot, without a care in the world.
I shouldn't have trusted him at all.

There is no fairness in this world. Mike's insurance
would have covered all the losses from the heist, and
he would have been none the worse for it. He'd still be
rich, and I wouldn't be miserable.

But here I am. And here I will remain. Forever.
